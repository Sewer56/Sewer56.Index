# About Me

Hi, I'm Sewer, an open source library author by day and singleplayer game modder/reverse engineer by night.

As long as, can remember, I've been tinkering with both software and hardware; originally being just an end user, with time, becoming a software developer myself. 

My first piece of what I could consider 'development work' growing up, would have been in 2012 with the Xperia Play, my first Android Device I received as a 13 year old. At the time, Android devices were very hardware constrained, with a single ~1GHz core and 512MB RAM (or less!), so as a tinkerer, many hardware enthusiasts ran Custom ROMs for better performance. 

As a power user, I became one of those ROM developers, creating stock-based ROMs such as [Gin2JellyBean Extended](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unofficial-sewers-mods-a-k-a-gin2jellybean-1-9-9-extended-rc1-2-3-7-addons.1934281/), for the Play and [OxySlim](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/indefinitely-postponed-oxyslim-23-02-2016-2-2-2.3278169/) for the OnePlus 2, also being a minor contributor of [halogenOS](https://halogenos.org), mostly providing the artwork used there.

My inspiration for starting programming for the first time came in 2015. I had a bit of nostalgia for a game I played as a child, [Sonic Heroes](./games/sonic-heroes.md); so I decided to try tinkering with it. My first experiences involved [reverse engineering the Object Placement format](https://info.sonicretro.org/SCHG:Sonic_Heroes/Object_Editing) using HxD; during the same time I got the opportunity to start picking up C# at school.  

In 2017, I met [Igor Seabra](https://github.com/igorseabra4), who also had passion for the game and thus, between the two of us, we spent the year cracking the game wide open; bringing even custom levels to the table and ultimately releasing [Heroes Tweakbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O3IDXzU5L8), as a celebration of that year's achievements.  

From there onwards, reverse engineering and modding games has became a hobby of mine, jumping in between different games to help various communities out; while also doing general open source library work and contributions. My work spans quite a few games, but I'm probably best known for [Reloaded-II, the next generation .NET based mod loader](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/). 

As for what I do these days? ***Currently looking for work*** while I still release new modifications, patches and libraries somewhat regularly. I also occasionally contribute to many Open Source Projects ([My GitHub Activity](https://github.com/Sewer56)). 

Example projects I've contributed to include [DotNetCorePlugins](https://github.com/natemcmaster/DotNetCorePlugins/pull/164), [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib/pull/416), [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools/pull/222), [il-repack](https://github.com/Alexx999/il-repack/pull/2), [vcdiff](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/vcdiff/pull/6) and even the [.NET Runtime itself](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/76559).
